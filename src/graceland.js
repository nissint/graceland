    * Everything registered with Graceland becomes a player. Players

    * Factories: A factory will be called with all the parameters in it's signature 
    * injected. Graceland assumes that a factory will return an object. Immediately
    * after being created, Graceland checks to see if the instance has an init() and
    * calles it if the method exists. Similarly, when Graceland.clear() is called, a
    * destroy() method is looked for on each existance and called if found.
    *
    * Libraries: A library is used when Graceland isn't to perform any instantiation
    * or dependency injection on the object.  This is useful for when one needs to inject
    * an unmolested function, class or object into a function.  It's possible that one
    * might need to do some preparation on the library after Graceland begins playing,
    * therefore a developer can define a prep() in the configuration information when
    * registering the library that will be run on startup.
    *
    * Values: Values are simple values like strings, primatives or even objects that are 
    * set as the instance value of the Player.
